          The Google Developer Student Club of Jadavpur University, JU. The Google
          Developer Student Club program is a program for university students,
          designed to help them build their technical skills and knowledge and
          ultimately apply these skills practically to build solutions and solve
          real world problems for local businesses and communities. It is open to
          any student, ranging from novice developers who are just starting, to
          advanced developers who want to further improve their skills. It is a
          space for students to learn and collaborate in a peer-to-peer learning
          environment. The GDSC will host events regarding the fields of web
          development, app development, competitive programming, machine learning,
          DSA and more. The aim of the club is to help students to bridge the gap
          between theory and practice, along with this - the students can build
          their professional and personal networks and get access to google
          developer resources.
